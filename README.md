# mock-cloud-firestore

Mock library for Cloud Firestore

## Installation

Assuming that you're using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager:

```
npm install --save-dev mock-cloud-firestore
```

If you're not using any module bundler, you can use the precompiled [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the `dist` folder. For this build, `MockFirebase` would be available as a `window.MockFirebase` global variable. You can download the files at [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/mock-cloud-firestore/).

## Usage
