# mock-cloud-firestore

Mock library for Cloud Firestore

Before using this library, try to see first if the [Firestore Emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_firestore) would fit your needs.

## Installation

Assuming that you're using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager:

```
npm install --save-dev mock-cloud-firestore
```

If you're not using any module bundler, you can use the precompiled [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) builds in the `dist` folder. For this build, `MockFirebase` would be available as a `window.MockFirebase` global variable. You can download the files at [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/mock-cloud-firestore/).

## Usage
